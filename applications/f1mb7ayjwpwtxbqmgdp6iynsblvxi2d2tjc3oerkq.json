    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Hybridization Chain Reaction\nFields: Molecular Biology/Neuroscience/Tissue Imaging, etc.\nIntroduction:\nHCR is a molecular probe technology used for signal amplification, commonly used to detect RNA or DNA in in situ hybridization experiments.\nThe principle is that when the probe molecules detect the target molecule, they self-assemble through a chain reaction, generating an amplified signal, thereby greatly improving detection sensitivity.\nIt is widely used in large-scale data acquisition projects such as brain science, developmental biology, and tissue clearing imaging.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Hybridization Chain Reaction\nFields: Molecular Biology/Neuroscience/Tissue Imaging, etc.\nIntroduction:\nHCR is a molecular probe technology used for signal amplification, commonly used to detect RNA or DNA in in situ hybridization experiments.\nThe principle is that when the probe molecules detect the target molecule, they self-assemble through a chain reaction, generating an amplified signal, thereby greatly improving detection sensitivity.\nIt is widely used in large-scale data acquisition projects such as brain science, developmental biology, and tissue clearing imaging.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use the aws cli tool to download data from AWS, cut the data into appropriate sizes and package them into car files, and finally send them to SP via http/hard disk mail.",

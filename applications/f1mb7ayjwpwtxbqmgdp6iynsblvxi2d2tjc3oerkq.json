    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Hybridization Chain Reaction\nFields: Molecular Biology/Neuroscience/Tissue Imaging, etc.\nIntroduction:\nHCR is a molecular probe technology used for signal amplification, commonly used to detect RNA or DNA in in situ hybridization experiments.\nThe principle is that when the probe molecules detect the target molecule, they self-assemble through a chain reaction, generating an amplified signal, thereby greatly improving detection sensitivity.\nIt is widely used in large-scale data acquisition projects such as brain science, developmental biology, and tissue clearing imaging.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Hybridization Chain Reaction\nFields: Molecular Biology/Neuroscience/Tissue Imaging, etc.\nIntroduction:\nHCR is a molecular probe technology used for signal amplification, commonly used to detect RNA or DNA in in situ hybridization experiments.\nThe principle is that when the probe molecules detect the target molecule, they self-assemble through a chain reaction, generating an amplified signal, thereby greatly improving detection sensitivity.\nIt is widely used in large-scale data acquisition projects such as brain science, developmental biology, and tissue clearing imaging.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use the aws cli tool to download data from AWS, cut the data into appropriate sizes and package them into car files, and finally send them to SP via http/hard disk mail.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://aind-open-data/HCR     1205.8201002644382 TiB\n\n\nexample:\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_BL6-000_2023-07-17_00-01-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_tim-r1-old_000001_2000-01-01_00-01-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_BL6-000_2023-06-07_00-00-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_BL6-001_2023-06-19_00-01-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_785830_2025-03-19_17-00-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_785830_2025-03-19_17-00-00_processed_2025-05-14_19-05-43\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_788639-25_2025-06-06_13-00-00\ns3://aind-open-data/HCR_785830_2025-03-19_17-00-00_processed_2025-05-20_22-16-06",

    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03289271 Germany\nf03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03368008 Vietnam\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03607310 Brazil\nf03603117 United States\nf03559187 United States\nf03100006 HongKong\nf03100007 HongKong",

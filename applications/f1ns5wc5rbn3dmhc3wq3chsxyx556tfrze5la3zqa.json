    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "Yes",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data we are planning to store mainly consists of media materials, including images, videos, documents, and other related content. Additionally, there are materials related to event organization.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1.Data Organization and Classification: We will categorize all media materials, such as images, videos, and documents. Each type of data will be divided into appropriate batches to facilitate subsequent uploading and management.\r\n2.Data Format and Compression: To ensure efficient data transmission and storage, we will perform appropriate format conversion and compression on the media data. Video files will be compressed using common formats such as MP4, images will use formats like JPEG or PNG, and documents will remain in standard formats such as PDF or DOCX.\r\n3.Data Encryption and Verification: To ensure data security, we will encrypt the data before uploading using standard encryption techniques like AES. At the same time, we will generate a hash value of the data to verify the integrity and consistency of the data after it is uploaded.\r\n4.Upload Tools: In terms of upload tools, we plan to use commonly used tools in the Filecoin ecosystem, such as Estuary or Lotus, to ensure the data is uploaded to the Filecoin network. We will choose appropriate tools for batch uploads based on the scale and type of data.\r\n5.Node Selection: To ensure high availability and retrieval efficiency, we will collaborate with storage providers (SPs) that meet the Filecoin Plus requirements. This will ensure that data is stored on multiple geographically distributed nodes with sufficient backup mechanisms.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://x.com/blocklikecom\r\nhttps://blocklikecom.medium.com/\r\n\r\nYou can see that the content on these platforms is the data we need to store.",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[ ] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02826588 guangdong\r\nf02827996 guangdong\r\nf02826007 singapore\r\nf01082888 hk\r\nf03081958 changsha",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"

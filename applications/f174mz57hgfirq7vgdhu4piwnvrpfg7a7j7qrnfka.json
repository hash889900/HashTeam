    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Experienced Personal Data Provider.The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a Chinese national scientific research facility operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 deg2\n in the sky. Until July 2017, LAMOST has completed its pilot survey which was launched in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the first five years of regular survey which was initiated on September 2012. After this six-year-survey, we totally obtain 9,026,365 spectra, which consist of stars, galaxies, quasars and other unknown objects[1−7]\n. Now, the fifth data release (DR5) has published online (http://dr5.lamost.org/), and released data products include：\n\nSpectra. - IIn general, there are 9,026,365 flux- and wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra in DR5, including 8,183,160 stars, 152,863 galaxies, 52,453 quasars, and 637,889 unknown objects, and these spectra cover the wavelength range of 3690-9100 angstrom with a resolution of 1800[2−3]\n at the 5500 angstrom.\nSpectroscopic Parameters Catalogs. - In this data release, six spectroscopic parameters catalogs are also published，and they are the LAMOST general catalog, the A, F, G and K type star catalog, the A type star catalog, the M dwarf catalog, the observed plate information catalog, and the input catalog respectively. In the LAMOST general catalog, it includes 36 columns of basic spectroscopic information, for example, right ascension, declination, signal to noise ratio, magnitude, classification and redshift, which are also provided by the A, F, G and K type star catalog, the A type star catalog, and the M dwarf catalog. These three catalogs also provide other parameters, for example, atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity), spectral line indices, line widths, the metallicity sensitive parameter, and the magnetic activity flag. In addition, the observed plate information catalog mainly contains nine basic plate information for all published plates, and the input catalog includes 24 basic fields mentioned above and three new fields which are not included in above catalogs.\n\nhttp://dr5.lamost.org/v3/doc/data-production-description\n\nGuoshoujing Telescope (the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope LAMOST) is a National Major Scientific Project built by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Funding for the project has been provided by the National Development and Reform Commission. LAMOST is operated and managed by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",
